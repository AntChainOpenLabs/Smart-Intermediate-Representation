# The Smart Intermediate Representation

[![Issues][issues-shield]][issues-url] [![MIT License][license-shield]][license-url]

The Smart Intermediate Representation(short for IR) project is a new compiler framework intended for smart contract development, which is mainly inspired by LLVM, MLIR and Solidity/Yul. The compiler's goals are:

* Trust and Security
* Rollup Friendly
* AI Friendly
* High Performance and Low Gas Cost

## Background

Since the circulation of Blockchain and Smart Contracts, there have been many incidents of exploitation. These incidents are mainly caused by attacks on unsafe smart contracts such as reentrancy issues, and compiler bugs. In the existing cases, it is difficult to investigate or locate once the attack occurs. Most safe/secure cases also require 3rd-party auditing which is very costly.

We propose a universal technical solution to be adapted to any programming language to help blockchain platform/developer make their smart contract trust, safe and high performance.

## Installation

Instructions about how to build and install the Smart Intermediate Representation compiler can be found in the [Development Guide](./doc/Development_Duide.md)

## Quick Start

### Example

Here is a "Hello World" hand-written program with debug information in the IR:

```sir
module_name = "HelloWorld"
contract HelloWorld {
    state {
    }
    pub fn HelloWorld.HelloWorld.init()  {
        0:
            ret()
    }

    pub fn HelloWorld.HelloWorld.greeting() -> str {
        1:
            call(@ir.builtin.print("hello": str, ) -> void, )
            ret("Hello world!": str, )
    }

}
```

For more examples of IR textual format programs, you can see [IR Example](./ir_example)

### Fetch the Docker Image and Build a Test IR Program

```shell
docker run smartir/cli:latest ir_cli build sir/example/hello_world.ir
```

## Documentation

The IR Specification document is [here](./doc/specification/SmartIR.md)

## Roadmap

> **ðŸ“¢ NOTE: This roadmap is tentative, it will be adjusted at any time**

The IR has a high level of compatibility with many blockchains. Here is a brief description of what we envision for the next versions.
